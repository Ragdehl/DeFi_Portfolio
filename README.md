# DeFi_Portfolio
Manage DeFi portfolio
This tool is intended to be used to manage your DeFi portfolio.
On the first version of the tool all the cryptocurrencies you have in your portfolio have to be filled manually (only prices are retreived automatically).
On future versions we intend to add automatical portfolio followup by providing your public address to the tool.
